                <h1>Tellaro, Italy</h1>
                <p>The snaking clifftop roads and a minuscule harbor have protected Tellaro from the wave of tourism that has swallowed other Ligurian seaside towns like Vernazza and Portofino. Here, a jumble of pastel buildings clings vertiginously to the sheer coast, providing the same cliff-hugging visual effect as the more-trafficked destinations. The village is located on the Golfo dei Poeti, which is named for the poets and literary icons like Lord Byron and D. H. Lawrence who once sought inspiration in this Mediterranean haven.</p>

                <h1>Bibury, England</h1>
                <p>The hilly Cotswold region is a designated "Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty" in southwestern England, and one of its loveliest villages is Bibury, where verdant meadows abut medieval stone cottages with steeply pitched roofs. The River Coln, which bisects the village, teems with trout, but the most scenic area is Arlington Row, a lane of sepia-hued cottages built in the 17th century to house weavers from the nearby Arlington Mill.</p>
